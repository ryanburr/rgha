# Coding Conventions

## Component Structure
- React components are located in [src/components](mdc:src/components)
- Each component should be in its own directory with an index.js file
- Use functional components with hooks
- Props should be properly typed

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow utility-first CSS approach
- Custom styles should be added to [src/styles](mdc:src/styles)
- Use clsx for conditional class names

## File Organization
- Keep components small and focused
- Use index.js files for cleaner imports
- Place shared utilities in [src/lib](mdc:src/lib)
- Store static data in [src/data](mdc:src/data)

## Best Practices
- Use ESLint for code linting
- Follow Prettier formatting rules
- Write clean, self-documenting code
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Use meaningful variable and function names
